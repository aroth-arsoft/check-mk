.PP
.IP "\fB255\fP"
The program has been signalled and terminated, because
the time has elapsed, before the program has exited itself.

normally. Strange. This should never happen.
.IP "\fB253\fP"
The program couldn't be executed.
.IP "\fB128\fP+\fIsignum\fP"
The program has terminated with
signal \fIsignum\fP \fBbefore\fP the time has elapsed (not
by waitmax, but by itself or some other process).
.IP "\fB1\fP"
Waitmax has been called with illegal options.
